I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:

And on the pedestal these words appear:
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away.

For both Jennifer and Priya to get the most out of their mentoring relationship, Jennifer should follow the mentoring program's guided activities and timelines. This action would: 1) show respect for the mentoring relationship and demonstrate her accountability as a mentor; 2) support Priya to meet the goals and objectives she has set, and; 3) provide Jennifer with opportunities to further develop skills, such as communication, and experience the satisfaction that comes with being a mentor. A strategy that Jennifer can use to get the most out of their meeting is to practice “reiterating and reviewing.” This approach makes sure that Jennifer and Priya are on the same page about what they discussed and what each of them has to do before they meet again. Jennifer can also use a checklist to keep track of their meetings and a focus on Priya's needs and concerns.",

I felt ashamed and wished I had someone who I could lean on for support. My experience in university is one of the main reasons I now volunteer as a mentor in the e-mentoring program for women seeking careers in business. I believe it's important for students to have someone outside their academic programs with whom they can speak about the profession. I see myself as a support for an individual but not in the same way as a counsellor or a parent.
